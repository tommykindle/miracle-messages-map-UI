                <p>We are a nonprofit reunion service to help our neighbors experiencing homelessness reunite with their
                    loved ones in a positive and supportive way. Our process is simple and effective: we train local
                    referral partners and volunteers (like you!) how to record and deliver Miracle Messages from their
                    homeless neighbors to their loved ones, as a step toward reuniting families. Volunteers and referral
                    partners use our mobile app, online referral form, paper form, or 1-800-MISS-YOU hotline to record
                    short video, audio, or text messages. Then, our volunteer “digital detectives” attempt to locate the
                    loved ones and deliver the message. Sign up to volunteer here!</p>

                <h2>Our vision, mission, and objectives</h2>

                <p>We are on a mission to end relational poverty on the streets, and inspire people everywhere
                    to embrace their homeless neighbors not as problems to be solved, but as people to be loved. </p>

                <p>We envision a world where everyone is nurtured by a social support system and sense of
                    belonging – a social home – whether or not they currently have stable housing. </p>

                <p>We are dedicated to reconnecting our homeless neighbors with their loved ones, in order to help
                    rebuild their social support systems and improve their physical, mental, and social well-being.</p>

                <div class="reconnect">
                    <h4>Reconnect</h4>
                    <p>82% of located loved ones are excited to reunite. Yet the average length of time disconnected is
                        a
                        staggering 20 years. We offer a humane way to help end homelessness: We reunite families.</p>

                <div class="reconcile">
                    <h4>Reconcile</h4>
                    <p>With their families, yes. But also with us as their neighbors: "the homeless" are not problems to
                        be
                        solved, they are people to be loved. We generate stories that humanize: We shatter stigmas.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="empower">
                    <h4>Empower</h4>
                    <p>550,000 people sleep on the streets every night in the US. Frustrated? You are not alone. We
                        offer
                        simple tools for residents to make a difference in their local community. We empower neighbors.
